We will use a set of similarity measures to find similar patterns in the smaller data set within the larger data set. 
The similarity measures may include simple correlation measures, euclidean distances, trend matching 
and can be extended up to complex machine learning algorithms like Artificial Neural Networks.
The methodology and algorithms to be used will depend on the nature of the data set and the scope of the project 
and will be finalized after discussion with the stakeholders of the project.
